# Calculate the sensitivity/specificity
# sensitivity = true positive / (true positive + false negative)
# e.g., sensitivity is the probability of a positive treatment response given that the patient has been treatment successfully.
# specificity = true negative / (true negative + false positive)
# e.g., specificity is the probability of a negative treatment response given that the patient has not been treatment successfully.
