# Calculate the sensitivity/specificity
# sensitivity = no. of true positive / (no. of true positive + no. of false negative)
## e.g., sensitivity is the probability of a positive treatment response given that the patient has been treatment successfully.

# specificity = no. of true negative / (no. of true negative + no. of false positive)
## e.g., specificity is the probability of a negative treatment response given that the patient has not been treatment successfully.

# positive predictive value = (no. of true positives) / (no. of true positives + no. of false positives) 
## e.g., positive predictive value is the probability of being treatmented successfully given a positive treatment response.

# negative predictive value = (no. of true negatives) / (no. of true negatives + no. of false negatives) 
## e.g., negative predictive value is the probability of not being treatmented successfully given a negative treatment response.
