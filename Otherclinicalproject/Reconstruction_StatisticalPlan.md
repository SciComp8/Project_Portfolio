## Data manipulation: 
	• Assign the appropriate type to each variable.
	• For the categorical variables, configure the appropriate reference group and level order. As suggested by XXX, consider categorizing the variable Diagnosis (DCIS, IDC, etc.) into three levels: Prophylaxis/Risk Reducing as the first level, Atypia/in Situ as the second level, and invasive as the third level.
	• Check the consistencies between the missing distributions of newly constructed variables and of the original variables.

## Data dictionary:
	• Write a variable definition section that clearly outlines the variable's full name, unit (if possible), and categorical and reference level.

## Table: characteristics of the study population
	• Prepare an overall summary table of patient characteristics which entails all variables excluding patient ID and procedure date.
	• Prepare a publication-ready overall summary table of patient characteristics which entails age at diagnosis, race (use Race 2, as suggested by XXX), patient primary language, patient-physician language concordance, insurance type, BMI, Charlson comorbidity index, ever/former smoker, diagnosis, surgeon gender, type of surgery, bilateral cancer, bilateral risk reducing, plastics referral, any reconstruction, and type of construction. This table should resemble the table 1 presented in a paper shared by XXX. Mean with standard deviation, and median with interquartile range and range will be used to describe the distributions of continuous variables. Count and percentage will be used to describe the distributions of categorical variables. 

## Table: characteristics of patients stratified by whether postmastectomy breast reconstruction was performed
	• Prepare a publication-ready summary table of patient characteristics which entails age at diagnosis, race (use Race 2, as suggested by XXX), patient primary language, patient-physician language concordance, insurance type, BMI, Charlson comorbidity index, ever/former smoker, diagnosis, surgeon gender, type of surgery, bilateral cancer, bilateral risk reducing, plastics referral, and type of construction. The chi-square test/Fisher's exact test will be used to examine the association between reconstruction yes/no and categorical variables (e.g., race, insurance type, ever/former smoker). The T-test/Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to examine the association between reconstruction yes/no and continuous variables (e.g., age at diagnosis, BMI, Charlson comorbidity index). This table should be similar to table 2 constructed in the paper mentioned earlier.

## Table: univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses of patient factors associated with reconstruction 
	• Construct the univariable logistic regression to assess predictive factors for reconstruction by utilizing patient characteristics outlined in the aforementioned table that examines the patient characteristics stratified by reconstruction status.
	• Construct the backward stepwise logistic regression to estimate the independent effects of factors predictive of reconstruction. The ideal full model should encompass patient characteristics that exhibit a minimum of 10 events (reconstruction yes) per candidate predictor, or preferably, 10 events per candidate predictor parameter. The multivariable logistic regression model will be forced to include the factors age at diagnosis and race. 
	• Assess the multicollinearity by utilizing the variance inflation factor (VIF) and adjusted VIF.
	• Prepare a publication-ready summary table of the univariable and multivariable logistic regression results. The table should resemble the structure of the table 3 presented in the paper.

## Figure: postmastectomy reconstruction rate over time
• Prepare a line plot which demonstrates the trend of the postmastectomy reconstruction rate over time. The reconstruction rate and time information is reflected in the variables Recon? (yes/no), and procedure year, respectively. As suggested by XXX, do not visualize the female surgeon volume over time. Similar to Figure 1 in the paper, the rate on the y-axis should be expressed in the percentage.
